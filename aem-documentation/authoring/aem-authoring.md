# AEM Authoring

Welcome to AEM Authoring guide. This guide will provide you the basics of AEM; starting from running the **Intance of AEM**, how to **Navigate** through AEM, the Structure of AEM to creating your own **Template and Custom Components**.

Follow these steps on getting started:

1. **Setting Up Your Code**

   - Create a _Folder_ where you want to insert the JAR file you requested. Name it whatever you want.
   - Download the **[aem-guides-wknd.all-2.1.4 and wknd](../files/)** zip file.
   - Extract the **[wknd](../files/)** zip file inside the _Folder_ you created and you will get this file structure
     <br><br>

   ```
   wknd
       + aem-guides-wknd
           + (... all the files needed for development)
       . .DS_Store
   ```

   - Cut the **aem-guides-wknd** out of the wknd folder and you're done with the first step.
